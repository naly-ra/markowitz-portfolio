# Markowitz Portfolio Optimization 
This project was made during a course on Optimization in Finance with python with Pr O. Gu√©ant. 
The aim was to analyze SBF120 stocks market data and to create performant portfolios using Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory.
Various risk metrics are also computed along portfolios to have a better sense of the performance of them.

# Example
You can initiate a `Portfolio` instance by running this line of code: 
```python
portfolio = Portfolio('ERC')
```
Where here ERC refers to the Equal Risk contribution Portfolio. 

You can also plot the strategies with the following lines of code: 
```python
portfolio.illustrate()
```
Where you will get the following graph.
